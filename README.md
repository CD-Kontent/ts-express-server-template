This is a simple server uusing Express and TypeScript.
I figured spinning up servers will be a thing I do a lot of, so it would be great to have a basic template ready to go.

### Included packages:
- dotenv
- nodemon
- concurrently (lets me run multiple commands, such as `nodemon` and `tsc`)

### Commands:
- `build`: compile code to `dist` directory
- `dev`: run server in development mode
